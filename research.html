<h4>
When Men Run Against Women: Evidence From Politicians' Manifestos
</h4>
<! end wip/#1 title >

<! start abstract >
<p>
Abstract: How does the entry of a woman change a political campaign? Using individual candidate manifestos, I combine computational text analysis with a regression discontinuity design in two-round French legislative elections to understand political campaign differences between women and men. Women tend to follow the party line and personalize their programs less. I causally show that this difference cannot be explained by exerting less effort when they campaign against a man in alternative to a woman or due to lower rhetorical skills since they participate in legislative debates as much as men. The explanation needs to rest on less support from the party. At the same time, female candidates tend to employ a more negative campaign and focus more on male-stereotyped topics. This behavior is strategic, as I causally prove that running against a man leads women to focus more on this topic. However, once elected, they debate more on topics where they have a comparative advantage (health & education). When male politicians run against a woman, they also strategically adapt their program, although left and right-wing politicians do it differently.

Ne me quitte pas! School closures and the rise of far-right in France
</h4>
<! end wip/#1 title >

<! start abstract >
<p>
Abstract: School closures and consolidation is a policy advocated in several OECD countries. This paper studies the impact of school closures on far-right votes in France between 1995 and 2022. Using a matched difference-in-differences design, we causally show that votes on the Rassemblement National increased by 0.713 percentage points in the first election in municipalities where the only school closed. This effect grows in the next three elections and reaches 1.818 percentage points. We show that voters leaving the municipality cannot explain this effect. However, we provide suggestive evidence that the increase was higher in places that initially voted more for the far-right. In municipalities with more than one school, an effect does not seem to exist, showing that citizens are concerned with the accessibility of public service.
