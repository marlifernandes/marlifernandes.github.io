<h4>
Ne me quitte pas! School closures and the rise of far-right in France
</h4>
<! end wip/#1 title >

Abstract: Governments around the world have been closing schools, mostly in rural areas, in the name of efficiency and costs reduction. This paper studies the impact of school closures on far-right vote in France, between 1995 and 2022. Using a matched difference-in-differences design, we causally show that in municipalities where the only school closed, votes on the Front National increased by 0.713 percentage points in the first election, an effect that grows in the next three elections and reaches the level of 1.818 percentage points. In municipalities with more than one school, an effect does not seem to exist, showing that citizens are concerned with the accessibility of the public service.

<h4>
The effects of non-cognitive skills on the native-migrant wage gap
</h4>
<! end wip/#1 title >

<p>
Abstract: Are there differences in non-cognitive skills between natives and immigrants that explain part of the native-immigrant wage gap? Using the German Socio-Economic Panel survey, I start by finding that natives and first-generation immigrants significantly differ on non-cognitive skills (Big Five Factor, locus of control, reciprocity and life goals). Immigrants outperform natives in terms of life goals, including importance of success, but under-perform in terms of external locus of control and emotional stability. Immigrants’ skills seem to be stable during their stay in the country. I conclude that differences in the Big Five Factor and locus of control explain 19 and 13 percent of the wage gap, while life goals tend to decrease it by 10 and 6 percent, respectively, for males and females. For comparison, human capital variables explain 39 and 13 percent of the wage gap, for men and women.
